It might take some adjusting, as the first few ideas will  likely \neither over-exaggerate or not go far enough. In our Ron White example the  CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00001247\nfirst ideas might have been either too small (“size of a termite”) or too large \n(“Size of a bus”) to be funny.\nOver-exaggeration will harm your trustworthiness. If you over-\nexaggerate the punchline, the audience sees you trying to stretch the joke \ntoo far and it “tears the joke.” There’s too much violation and not enough \nsafety.\nIf you under-exaggerate the punchline then it might come out boring. \nThere can be too much safety and not enough violation.\nFind The Best Level of Exaggeration \nThe biggest problem new comedian run into while using the exaggeration \ntechnique is not optimizing the amount of exaggeration they use. Allow \nyourself to play around with this technique. Purposefully find how much \nexaggeration you can get away with. Not only will it make writing more fun, \nbut it’ll also teach you how to use exaggerations effectively.CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00001347\nHow To Write An Exaggeration \nIn this example, lets write about an experience you had recently.\n1.Write a few sentences about an experience\n2.Look over what you’ve written and find ideas that can \nexaggerated (size, emotional reactions, etc.)\n3.Rewrite or add on to what you’ve written using the exaggeration.\n4.Rewrite the joke so that it flows better.\n \nMY EXAMPLE: \n1.I went to Costco. That store is huge.\n2.(I’ll exaggerate “huge”)\n3.I went to Costco. That store is huge. It’s so huge that I didn’t realize \nthey sold camping gear ... I thought people just gave up and pitched \na tent.\n4.I went to Costco. That store is huge... I didn’t realize they sold \ncamping gear ...

punchline \nin this joke needs to create a link between “a frisbee getting closer and \ncloser” and “wondering  about something.”CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00002747\nI went to buy some camouflage pants the other day but I ______________.\nThe puns below are slightly more difficult. This one has 2 steps. The first \nstep is the same as above: figure out what links the setup and punchline. \nThe second step is figuring out how to structure the punchline to create \ncomedic conflict.\nA doctor tells a woman she can no longer touch anything alcoholic. So \nshe ___________.\nThe punchline needs to account for all the information in the setup. A good \npunchline for this setup needs to use the word “alcoholic” in a new way. \nThe safe interpretation inside the setup is an “alcoholic drink.” But you can’t \nsimply put in “alcoholic person” into the blank. The correct answer will \n“suggest” an alcoholic person, but not say it explicitly. There are many \npossible punchlines for this setup, but all of the good punchlines will share \nthe same “alcoholic person” suggestion.\n  CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00002847\nPUNCH-TO-SETUP \nThese puns are slightly different in that they were most likely written \npunchline-first... only later did the comedian come back and write a setup.\nMy dad suggested I register for a donor card. He’s a man after my own \nheart \nI’ve decided to sell my Hoover... well, it was just collecting dust.\nFor these 2 jokes, it would be far easier to begin with the punchline and \nwork backwards. Try finishing the joke below. You’ll notice that you get to \nstart with a fun phrase (like the one’s above).\nAbout a month before he died, my uncle _________________. After \nthat, he went down hill fast.\nThere are several possible answers that would make sense.

In my example, I say that I “went” to the store, so you know it’s in the \npast... but that’s all.

take that it’s almost impossible to stay \nfocused on the part of comedy that you love... BEING FUNNY! CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u0000447\nExample: Rule of Three \nFor example, the RULE OF THREE joke format always lists 3 items. The \n1st and 2nd item are common while the 3rd item breaks the pattern created \nby the other two. This is a very common way of creating comedic conflict by \ncreating a “BROKEN PREDICTION.” The Rule of Three is highly \nstructured, meaning you can’t play around with it. You either do it or you \ndon’t. However, Broken Predictions are super-easy to make and achieve \nthe same results. This is much closer aligned to how you NATURALLY \nmake people laugh.\nQuick Tips \nDon’t explicitly use these joke formats. If you ever catch yourself \nasking “Should I use a Rule Of Three joke here?” ... then you’re \nmissing the point. Best case scenario, you will come out VERY \nmechanical and choppy. However, if you understand how to create the \ncomedic conflict then you’ll no longer have to worry about the structure of \nthe material.\nJoke formats are probably the most over-emphasized part of stand-up \ncomedy. Today joke formats play a much smaller role than they did in early \nstand-up comedy. They still do have their place in stand-up comedy... just \nnot in the spotlight.CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u0000547\nJoke formats are very useful for:\n1.Learning the basics of stand-up comedy (We’re using them to \ndiscover more about comedic conflict)\n2.Punching up your material. (We can always go back after our \nwriting and punch-up material using these strategies)\n \nSummary: Intro to Joke Types\n1.Use joke formats to A) Learn the basics of comedy and B) punch-up \nyour material\n2.Don’t try to write “into” a joke format.

Jimmy Carr:\n“I got a friend, she’s got a theory. She reckons the way to drive \na man wild with desire  is to nibble on his earlobes for hours and \nhours... I think it’s bollox.”\nIn this pun the word bollox has two different meanings. The first way the \nword is interpreted is to mean “A lie” or “B.S.” Soon after the audience \narrives at the first meaning of the term the audience realizes that the \ncomedian is saying more than what was gleaned from the first \ninterpretation. If the comedian were to keep talking, the pun would have \nbeen lost. If Carr said “I think it’s bollox because...” the audience would \nhave retained their first definition of the word and not inquired further. The \ncomedian indirectly hinted at the pun when he stopped talking. This leads \nthe audience to re-define the term ‘bollox’ to mean “testicles,” where the \naudience arrives at the humor. CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00002647\nPUN PRACTICE \nLet’s take a look at some examples of puns to learn how to write our own. \nMany puns begin with a word or phrase that has a double-meaning. These \npuns only have a single step to solve.\nI saw a documentary on how ships are kept together. __________! \nI needed a password eight characters long so I picked _____________.\nTo finish these puns, you need to figure out the alternative meanings that \nare being used. The first pun links together the phrase “how ships are kept \ntogether” with a word for excitement.\nThe password pun can be solved by realizing that “character” can also \nmean “person in a movie/show/etc.” So all you need to do is find a single \nanswer. The correct punchline will link the setup and punchline together so \nthat “8 characters” are on the left side and “8 characters” is on the right.\nStanding in the park, I was wondering why a Frisbee gets larger the closer \nit gets.

can fill in the rest.\nFor it to work effectively, you MUST give the audience enough \ninformation to fill in the punchline the way you want it filled in. In the \nexamples below, notice how easy it is to fill in the blank.\nMost omitted punchlines substitute a gesture for the missing words. \nThis makes it quicker for the audience to recognize the punchline. (NOTE: \nConventional punchlines often use voice inflection to signal a punchline)\nThis type of punchline is a fun way of boosting the playfulness of your \nmaterial. They don’t actually create any comedic conflict themselves, but \nthey do change the comedic conflict by making your punchline more \nplayful. That playfulness can make a punchline feel safer (increase the \nsafety circle of your comedic conflict) and even boost the quality of the \nlaugh.\nNotice how playful and safe this omitted punchline feels: CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00003847\nEddie Izzard: The Rules of Advertising – Sex Sells \nShagging sells everything! \nThat’s it, there’s an advert for coffee- \nYou come around, “Cup of coffee?” \n“Ooh, let’s shag!”\nYes!

If you’ve \nseen my Great American Comedy Festival video, you saw me use this \ntactic:\n“I applied to Wal-Mart and they finally hired me.

I didn’t realize they sold \ncamping gear ... I thought people just gave up and pitched a tent. CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00001447\nMisplaced Sincerity \nMisplaced Sincerity is one of my favorite joke formats. This is where the \ncomedian pretends to lack a certain knowledge or awareness of what the \naudience knows to be true. Listen to any Steve Martin CD and you’ll hear \nplenty of misplaced sincerity. Here’s an example from Martin (Steve \nMartin: French Video):\n“I went to France. If you go to France let me give you a \nwarning... “Chapeau,” means “Hat”... ...“Oeuf,” means “Egg”... \n... It’s like those French have a different word for \nEVERYTHING!”\nSAFETY: How a normal person would understand or interpret something. \nVIOLATION: The comedians incorrect understanding or interpretation. \nCOMEDIC CONFLICT: Misplaced sincerity creates comedic conflict by \nallowing the audience to see two sides of the same situation at the same \ntime.\nThe misplaced sincerity is easy to catch in the Steve Martin example. \nMartin pretends he doesn’t understand there are other languages \nbesides English. The audience is allowed to simultaneously view both \ntheir own POV as well as Steve Martin’s POV. The incongruency \nbetween Steve Martin’s POV and the audience’s create comedic conflict.CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00001547\nAnother great example of misplaced sincerity is from Eddie Izzard. Izzard \nreceived an applause break when he briefly stopped his material on Ireland \nand said to his American crowd “You do know there are other countries?”\nObviously, yes. But Izzard delivered this line as if he wasn’t 100% sure. \nJust as in our Steve Martin example, the audience was allowed to see \ntwo different POV’s at once. They saw it from their own perspective as \nwell as an outside perspective.\nIn the audience’s mind they knew he was playfully teasing Americans for \nbeing egotistical and oblivious to world events.

trading a ‘general idea’ for a \nspecific idea we get a clearer (and more entertaining) picture of the  story or \npunchline. Take this Ron White example (Ron White: Hurricane Video):\n“Let me make something clear. It’s not THAT the wind is \nblowin’... it’s WHAT, the wind is blowing... if you get hit by \na Volvo... it doesn’t matter how many sit-ups you did that night.”\nYou can tell from reading this line that the word “Volvo” is what makes the \njoke funny. But the comedic conflict is deeper. The joke has nothing to do \nwith Volvos... You can replace Volvo with another car type and it’d probably \nwork the same. The purpose of saying Volvo is 2-fold:\nFirst, the specificity gives all audience members the same mental \npicture. If you were to say “Automobile” then there would be many different \ninterpretations by the audience. Some audience members would have the \nmental image of a Mac Truck (Which would have been an over-\nexaggeration); some would think about an RV, others would think about \ntheir station-wagon. CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00004447\nSecond, choosing Volvo added a new layer to the joke. If you have to \ndecide which specific object to choose, choose one that adds flavor to the \njoke. Volvos are known to be the safest cars in America. This irony makes \nthe joke even better. Not only is he hit by a car... he’s hit by THE SAFEST \ncar.\nHINT: Brand names are great for specificity because A) the audience all \nhas the same knowledge about them and B) brand names try to be known \nfor something (Volvo = safety). This information can be used to add more \nhumor to a punchline.\n CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00004547\nHow to Write Specificity \nLike many of our examples here, start with something

be back in his hometown and poof! He was \ngone. The third person’s wish was “I want my friends back.” CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00002447\nThis is a great example of the Rule of Three. The first two designate a \npattern of wanting to be home. The third breaks the pattern by wishing for \nsomething else, which incidentally negates the other two. This joke format \nworks because it breaks the audience’s assumption that the third person is \ngoing to wish for something similar to the first two.\nThis joke formula isn’t as effective today because, if you don’t hide it well \nenough, the audience can easily tell that the third item is going to break \ntheir assumption. So instead of “assuming the third item will be the same” \nthey actually get ahead of you and assume that the third item will be \ndifferent... they just don’t know HOW it will be different. This is why it can \nbe so difficult to get away with this joke type. If you use it, make sure you \nhide it well and that there’s a good payoff in the end.\n \nSummary: Rule of Three\n1.Comedian gives the audience a list containing 3 items. Item #1 and \n#2 create a pattern (safety). Item #3 breaks the pattern.\n2.Rule of Three is extremely difficult to use effectively. Most audiences \nhave seen enough comedy or heard enough jokes to understand that \nthe third item is going to be a surprise that breaks their \nassumptions... which means they never make an assumption in the \nfirst place.CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00002547\nPun / Double-Entendre \nThe double-entendre, better known as a pun, is often said to be the lowest \nform of humor. The reason for this is because coming up with a corny pun \nis extremely easy. You can take almost any word in the English language, \nfind an alternate meaning, and then create a pun from it.\nMany comedians have used puns very effectively to create good quality \nhumor.

happening or the entire joke will feel forced. There will \nbe very little safety and too much violation. CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00001847\nLike all types of POV Humor, the humor comes from the audience’s ability \nto see two different POV’s at the same time. (POV Humor is explored in \nmore depth in the advanced level of Faster & Funnier)\n3 types of contradictions: \n1.Words contradict Words\n2.Words contradict Actions\n3.Words contradict What Audience Already Knows\n \nWords v. Words \nThe simplest type of contradiction is having your words contradict other \nwords or the manner in which the words are said.\nOne example of this comes from Steve Martin:\n“But it’s an intellectual town, and I’m an intellectual ‘Kiiinndd’ of \nguy.”\nIn this example Martin uses his ‘dumb voice’ when saying he’s an \nintellectual. By drawing out the word “kind” he creates contradiction \nbetween saying he’s an intellectual and saying the line like he’s stupid. The \nconflict between these two ideas creates humor.CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00001947\nSarcasm falls in this category. Sarcasm gets humor from a comedic conflict \nbetween words and HOW the words are said. When using sarcasm, the \nwords you say are contradicted by the voice you use (i.e., saying “you’re a \ngenius” in a way that means “You’re an idiot”).\nWords v. Actions \nAnother form of contradiction is using your words to contradict your \nactions. The best example of this type of contradiction also comes from \nSteve Martin when he told the audience,\n“I can “Drink as much alcohol as I want... And it doesn’t affect \nme!” [Loses balance and crashes into the mic stand]\nWords v. What Audience Already Knows \nThe last type of contradiction I will highlight is using your words to \ncontradict something already known (such as who the audience knows \nyou to be).

forgot the line and the context would have CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00003547\ncompletely changed. You’ll  be on a new subject. This provides the \naudience with the surprise and the change in context that makes the tag \nline powerful. It should go without saying that the callback should make \nsense when you use it. The context will change, but the line needs to fit in \nto your new subject.\nAlso, you’ll find that callbacks are much more useful during longer sets. If \nyou are on stage for only five minutes, you can still use a callback, but you \ncan’t have a long enough interval between the original line and the callback \nto maximize effectiveness. You’ll have to wait until later in your career to \nget the full benefits. I still recommend using them even during shorter sets. \nNot only will you get some benefit out of it, but you’ll also learn how to use \nthem comfortably. By the time you get to the point in your career where \nyou’re performing longer sets, you’ll be an expert at using this technique.\nIf you’ve spent time watching comedy, you might have noticed that a lot of \ncomedians like to end their sets on a callback. While this is definitely not \nnecessary, doing this brings your comedy full circle and gives it an \nenjoyable ending.\nOne of the best ways to learn how to use callback lines is to watch any \nEddie Izzard DVD. His DVDs are often well over an hour long and contain \nnumerous callbacks throughout his set. You’ll also notice from Izzard that \nhis callbacks aren’t always entire punch lines. One of Izzard’s best  CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00003647\ncallbacks in Dressed To Kill is simply the word “Ciao” (chow) spoken in an \nItalian accent.\nSummary: Callbacks\n1.A callback line

almost always leads to \nawkward sounding material or a weak punchline. Use Comedic \nConflict instead. CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u0000647\nBroken Assumptions \nEvery time you speak you’re giving the listener information about the who, \nwhat, where, when, why, or how of your story. Some of this information \nis EXPLICIT, meaning you actually say it. The rest is IMPLICIT, meaning \nthe listener assumes it.\nLets take a normal sentence, like”I went to the grocery store.” The \nsentence explicitly tells you WHO (“I”) and WHERE (“grocery store”), but \nnot WHAT, WHEN, WHY, or HOW. So 2 pieces of information \nare explicit (written in green)\nWho – What – Where – When – Why – How\nNext, you make assumptions: You know GROCERY STORE, so \nit’s IMPLIED that I want to buy food. You likely assume that I drove a car or \nwalked as well. Now you have 4 pieces of information (the assumptions are \nin red):\nWho – What – Where – When – Why – How\nI call the break from the assumption to the new interpretation “shifts” \nbecause the punchline shifts the original understanding of the joke. \nThe safety of the joke comes from the first interpretation. The punchline CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u0000747\ncreates a violation by changing one of the assumptions created. \nConventional jokes almost always use these “shifts” to create humor.\nTake this setup from Steve Martin:\nI gave my cat a bath the other day... they love it. He sat there, he enjoyed \nit, and  it was fun for me too.\nAs an audience member, here’s what we EXPLICITLY know (green):\nWho – What – Where – When – Why – How\nAnd here’s what we can safely assume

know exactly what I’m doing... I’m setting up a joke. That \ncreates the expectation that I will finish  the joke the same way you’ve heard \nit finished before. The violation comes when you hear that the punchline is \nactually making fun of the style of joke that I’m telling you instead of what \nyou expected.\nComedians like Steve Martin and Albert Brooks made meta-comedy \nfamous in stand-up. Both comedians became what you could call “Meta-\nComedians.” Their stage persona was basically comedy ‘about’ comedians. \nThey made fun of comedians in the same way that meta-jokes make fun of \njokes. They made fun of who comedians are by poking their finger in the \neye of the comedian’s persona.\n  CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00003247\nSummary: Meta-Jokes\n1.Meta jokes are “Jokes about jokes”\n2.Create an expectation of a “normal finish to a joke.” That expectation \nis broken when the punchline makes fun of the joke itself.\n3.Meta-jokes were popularized by Steve Martin and Albert Brooks. Both \nwere known as “anti-comedians”CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00003347\nCallback Lines \nA callback line is a line that you used earlier on in your set that you can \nreuse for another bit. These lines “call back” to an earlier punchline or \nreference.\nLike meta-jokes, callback lines use references to create comedic conflict. \nWhereas a meta-joke references a joke-style that’s being made fun of, a \ncallback line references something the comedian said earlier in the show \n(or even something that happened before the comedian took the stage).\nIt creates comedic conflict by “repurposing” what was already said. The \nsafety comes from the original context or meaning of the sentence while \nthe violation comes from the new context or meaning.\nWhat makes callbacks so powerful is their ability to be extremely short and \nconcise while still drawing up an entire idea.

opened up a show saying, \n“I’m feelin’ kinda hyper.” The audience knows Steven Wright for his dry \nvoice  and lack of inflection, not something you associate with being hyper. \nSaying “I’m hyper” completely contradicted who the audience knew him to \nbe. This comedic conflict between these two ideas caused the humor. CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00002047\nIn all of the examples I’ve listed above the humor comes out of the conflict \nbetween two contrary ideas. The laughter doesn’t come from the words \nthemselves, but from the POV of the person saying those words. Because \nit’s a type of POV joke, it’s very important to sell these jokes with a lot of \nconfidence.

earlier on in the set. Just by bringing up a small \nphrase from an older punch line is sufficient to  bring the entire idea behind \nthat joke (including the setup) into the present.\nThe second reason they’re powerful is because they provide a sense of \ncommunity with your audience. A callback is basically an “Inside-joke.” In \norder to get the joke you must share some common experience with each  CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00003447\nother, and that common experience is the original line you’re calling back \nto. If you had walked in after the original punch line and heard the callback \nline later on in the show, you’d be very confused as to why the audience \nwas laughing so hard at the line. Nothing about it would seem special to \nyou. But you can tell you missed something important because everyone \nelse in the audience had a completely different reaction. The audience \nmembers that are in on the joke have formed a community. Now, instead of \nlistening to ‘a comedian’ they feel like they’re a part of something. It’s like \nthat joke was just for them.\nThere are several important characteristics of callbacks that you need to \nknow in order to use them effectively.\nThe first is that the audience needs to forget about the line. If you are \nsimply calling back to what happened only a moment ago in your set, you’ll \nlose the majority of its power. The power isn’t coming from the actual line, \nbut from the surprise that the line is being reused and the context that you \nare using the line. If you use a callback too early, the context will be almost \nidentical to the original line. There will be nothing ‘special’ about it.

Start with something pre-written.\n1.Begin with something pre-written or write a few sentences of a setup.\n2.Find any ideas or phrases that are easy to \nmisunderstand or require specific knowledge (phrases like “Go \njump on a horse” or “Raining cats and dogs” are easy)\n3.Ask yourself “What would happen if I misunderstood or didn’t have \nthis information?”\n4.Write a follow-up that assumes you “missed the point”CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00001747\nContradictions \nContradiction is a mixture of misplaced sincerity, irony, and POV humor.\nIn a contradiction, the comedian says a line that contradicts what he’s \nmeaning to say. The misplaced sincerity comes from the fact that the \ncomedian fails to notice that the line is contradictory to either the words \nhe’s using, the actions he’s taking, or who the audience knows him to be.\nThere are 2 important characteristics to a good contradiction: speed and \nbelievability.\nThe contradiction must be fast enough for the audience to compare the 2 \nPOVs. As a general rule, you have about 1-2 lines to create the \ncontradiction.\nSecond, the contradiction should be believable. Contradictions are easy to \nmake... contradictions that don’t feel forced are difficult. If you tell a story \nabout a vegetarian eating a hot dog, you have to give the audience a good \nreason to believe it’s happening or the entire joke will feel forced.

in a monotone voice the audience might have \nmistaken his pause as him trying to find the next words.  But since he was CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00004147\nusing his voice inflection to lead them, the entire audience knew exactly \nwhere he was going. By omitting the punch line, Caparulo empowered the \naudience to fill in the rest.\nThis tactic works well because a pause conveys an idea in itself. A pause \nis much more than the absence of speaking. In a sense, the audience sees \nthat the comedian as speechless; he is unable to explain everything that is \ngoing through his head. In Caparulo’s case, the idea that being chased by \na swan would look ridiculous isn’t as funny as the idea that the comedian \ncan’t even come up with words to express the idea.\nAnother great feature of the pause is that it lets the audience \nparticipate in your comedy. Instead of the audience being ‘told’ what to \nthink, the comedian is allowing them to put the pieces together for \nthemselves. The audience is no longer just a ‘listener’ but an active \nparticipant, taking all the clues that were given (words, vocal inflections, \ngestures, context, etc.) and putting them together to arrive at a conclusion \n(the punch line).\n  CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00004247\nSummary: Omitted Punchlines\n1.Yo u  MUST give the audience enough information to fill in the \nmissing punchline themselves. For it to work, the audience must \nknow EXACTLY what you want them to do.\n2.They can make violations feel a little safer. (YOU aren’t the one \nwho filled in the dirty word... THEY did.) Recall Izzard’s “Advertising \nDog Food” joke)\n3.omitted punchlines allow the audience to participate in the humorCreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00004347\nSpecificity \nSpecificity enhances storytelling in much the same way that exaggeration \ndoes. Specificity doesn’t actually create comedic conflict, but it does make \nyour punchlines more fun and playful. By trading a ‘general idea’ for a \nspecific idea we get a clearer (and more

Instead \nof running together the two sentences, he places a break in between them \nand lets the audience fill in the rest.\nBut Caparulo didn’t just let the audience think of ‘anything,' he gave clues \nusing gestures and voice inflection to lead all the audience members to the \nsame conclusion. Caparulo’s gestures and voice inflections all pointed to \nhow bizarre and pathetic it would look to be running away from a swan.

understand a \njoke: construction, recognition, and resolution. During construction the \nlistener picks  out what they think will be important information. By editing \nout the WHEN in our joke, the comedian makes it easier for the audience to \nfigure out what information will be important to the punchline. Do not give \nthe audience too much info or they will have to sort through tons of \ninformation to construct a joke.\n  CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00001047\nSummary: Broken Assumptions\n1.When you speak, you are giving the listener \nboth EXPLICIT and IMPLICIT information about the Who, What, \nWhere, When, Why, and How of your story.\n2.The audience creates assumptions based on the explicit information. \nThese assumptions are then broken in the punchline.\n3.“When” is often left out of material or quickly brushed aside with a \ncomment like “lately” or “awhile back”CreativeStandUp.com\n\u0000 of \u00001147\nExaggerations \nA very common joke formula is Exaggeration.

Notice how Cook uses a lot of \nexaggerations in the video below, but he’s not always trying to create \npunchlines... he’s just trying to make the story more interesting. (Dane \nCook: Kool-Aid Man)\nComedian Ron White uses exaggeration in a joke format very effectively in \nhis line:\n“We were on a plane ‘that’ big... like a pack of bubble gum with \n8 people on it.”\nIn order to create an exaggeration from a joke format, take your punchline’s \nkey word/s (the one/s that makes it funny) and see if you can stretch it one \nway or the other. If the joke is about size (like Ron White’s joke) than ask \nyourself “What’s really small/big” and fit it inside your joke until you find the \nright one.
